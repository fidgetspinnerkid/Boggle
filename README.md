## Boggle
A boggle game and solver. When it is run, it serves up a random boggle game board and allows you to input words. When the game is terminated, it totals up your score and tells you the longest possible word and how many of the possible words you got.

## Motivation
This was an AoPS assignment. I extended this assignment by building in a solver that was sped up by using multiprocessing.
